# WebGL-FastFood
Individual project for my Computer Graphics class using WebGL to create a 3D scene.

## Initial Plan

### Scene
The inside of a fast food restaurant. There will be one counter with a cash register and some tables and chairs. The objects will need to have shadows according to the light present at the top of the room. If there is time to do so, food will also be added to the tables. Sketch of the desired scene:

* Tools: The three.js library, a WebGL object loader (https://www.npmjs.com/package/webgl-obj-loader) and some 3D models in .obj format may need to be used alongside WebGL.
