# WebGL-FastFood
Individual project for my Computer Graphics class using Unity and WebGL to create a 3D scene.

## Initial Plan

### Scene
The inside of a fast food restaurant. There will be one counter with a cash register and some tables and chairs. The objects will need to have shadows according to the light present at the top of the room. If there is time to do so, food will also be added to the tables. Sketch of the desired scene:

* Tools: Unity to create the scene and to export it as a WebGL file (https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/how-to-publish-for-webgl?signup=true#5d92519bedbc2a130fa21789).
